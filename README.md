## Introduction 

Visual perception entails solving a wide set of tasks (e.g. object detection, depth estimation, etc). The predictions made for each task out of a particular observation are not independent, and therefore, are expected to be **consistent**.

**What is consistency?** Suppose an object detector detects a ball in a particular region of an image, while a depth estimator returns a flat surface for the same region. This presents an issue -- at least one of them has to be wrong, because they are _inconsistent_.

**Why is it important?** 
1. Desired learning tasks are usually predictions of different aspects of a single underlying reality (the scene that underlies an image). Inconsistency among predictions implies contradiction. 
2. Consistency constraints are informative and can be used to better fit the data or lower the sample complexity. They may also reduce the tendency of neural networks to learn "surface statistics" (superficial cues) by enforcing constraints rooted in different physical or geometric rules. This is empirically supported by the improved generalization of models when trained with consistency constraints.

**How do we enforce it?** The underlying concept is that of path independence in a network of tasks. Given an endpoint `Y2`, the path from 
`X->Y1->Y2` should give the same results as `X->Y2`. This can be generalized to a larger system, with paths of arbitrary lengths. In this case, the nodes of the graph are our prediction domains (eg. depth, normal) and the edges are neural networks mapping these domains.

This repository includes [training](#training) code for enforcing cross task consistency, [demo](#run-demo-script) code for visualizing the results of a consistency trained model on a given image and [links](#pretrained-models) to download these models. For further details, refer to our [paper]() or [website](https://consistency.epfl.ch/).


#### Consistency Domains

Consistency constraints can be used for virtually any set of domains. This repository considers transferring between image domains, and our networks were trained for transferring between the following domains from the [Taskonomy dataset](https://github.com/StanfordVL/taskonomy/tree/master/data).

    Curvature         Edge-3D            Reshading
    Depth-ZBuffer     Keypoint-2D        RGB       
    Edge-2D           Keypoint-3D        Surface-Normal 


The repo contains consistency-trained models for `RGB -> Surface-Normals`,  `RGB -> Depth-ZBuffer`, and `RGB -> Reshading`. In each case the remaining 7 domains are used as consistency constraints in during training.

Descriptions for each domain can be found in the [supplementary file](http://taskonomy.stanford.edu/taskonomy_supp_CVPR2018.pdf) of Taskonomy.

#### Network Architecture

All networks are based on the [UNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) architecture. They take in an input size of 256x256, upsampling is done via bilinear interpolations instead of deconvolutions and trained with the L1 loss. See the table below for more information.

|        Task Name        | Output Dimension | Downsample Blocks |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `RGB -> Depth-ZBuffer`  | 256x256x1        | 6                 |
| `RGB -> Reshading`      | 256x256x1        | 5                 |
| `RGB -> Surface-Normal` | 256x256x3        | 6                 |

Other networks (e.g. `Curvature -> Surface-Normal`) use a UNet, their architecture hyperparameters are detailed in [transfers.py](./transfers.py).

More information on the models, including download links, can be found [here](#pretrained-models) and in the [supplementary material](https://consistency.epfl.ch/supplementary_material).

## Installation

There are two convenient ways to run the code. Either using Docker (recommended) or using a Python-specific tool such as pip, conda, or virtualenv.

#### Installation via Docker [Recommended]

We provide a docker that contains the code and all the necessary libraries. It's simple to install and run.
1. Simply run:
<!-- docker pull epflvilab/xtconsistency:latest -->
```bash
docker run --runtime=nvidia -ti --rm epflvilab/xtconsistency:latest
```
The code is now available in the docker under your home directory (`/app`), and all the necessary libraries should already be installed in the docker.

#### Installation via Pip/Conda/Virtualenv
The code can also be run using a Python environment manager such as Conda. See [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for complete list of packages. We recommend doing a clean installation of requirements using virtualenv:
1.  Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:EPFL-VILAB/XTConsistency.git
cd XTConsistency
```

2. Create a new environment and install the libraries:
```bash
conda create -n testenv -y python=3.6
source activate testenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quickstart (Run Demo Locally)

#### Download the consistency trained networks
If you haven't yet, then download the [pretrained models](#Download-consistency-trained-models). Models used for the demo can be downloaded with the following command:
```bash
sh ./tools/download_models.sh
```

This downloads the `baseline`, `consistency` trained models for `depth`, `normal` and `reshading` target (1.3GB) to a folder called `./models/`. Individial models can be downloaded [here](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/QPvImzbbdjBKI5P).

#### Run a model on your own image

To run the trained model of a task on a specific image:

```bash
python demo.py --task $TASK --img_path $PATH_TO_IMAGE_OR_FOLDER --output_path $PATH_TO_SAVE_OUTPUT
```

The `--task` flag specifies the target task for the input image, which should be either `normal`, `depth` or `reshading`.

To run the script for a `normal` target on the [example image](./assets/test.png):

```bash
python demo.py --task normal --img_path assets/test.png --output_path assets/
```

It returns the output prediction from the baseline (`test_normal_baseline.png`) and consistency models (`test_normal_consistency.png`).

Test image                 |  Baseline			|  Consistency
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------: |:-------------------------:
![](./assets/test_scaled.png)|  ![](./assets/test_normal_baseline.png) |  ![](./assets/test_normal_consistency.png)


Similarly, running for target tasks `reshading` and `depth` gives the following.

  Baseline (reshading)      |  Consistency (reshading)   |  Baseline (depth)	       |  Consistency (depth)
:-------------------------: |:-------------------------: | :-------------------------: |:-------------------------:
![](./assets/test_reshading_baseline.png) |  ![](./assets/test_reshading_consistency.png) | ![](./assets/test_depth_baseline.png) |  ![](./assets/test_depth_consistency.png)

## Energy Computation

Training with consistency involves several paths that each predict the target domain, but using different cues to do so. The disagreement between these predictions yields an unsupervised quantity, _consistency energy_, that our CVPR 2020 paper found correlates with prediciton error. You can view the pixel-wise _consistency energy_ (example below) using our [live demo](https://consistency.epfl.ch/demo/).


|             Sample Image             |             Normal Prediction             |             Consistency Energy             |
|:------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| <img src=./assets/energy_query.png width="600">  | <img src=./assets/energy_normal_prediction.png width="600">  | <img src=./assets/energy_prediction.png width="600">  |
| _Sample image from the Stanford 2D3DS dataset._  | _Some chair legs are missing in the `RGB -> Normal` prediction._  |  _The white pixels indicate higher uncertainty about areas with missing chair legs._  | 


To compute energy locally, over many images, and/or to plot energy vs error, you can use the following `energy_calc.py` script. For example, to reproduce the following scatterplot using `energy_calc.py`:

|             Energy vs. Error             |
|:----------------------------------------:|
| ![](./assets/energy_vs_error.jpg)        |
| _Result from running the command below._ | 



First download a subset of images from the Taskonomy buildings `almena` and `albertville` (512 images per domain, 388MB):
```bash
sh ./tools/download_data.sh
```


Second, download all the networks necessary to compute the consistency energy. The following script will download them for you (skipping previously downloaded models) (0.8GB - 4.0GB):
```bash
sh ./tools/download_energy_graph_edges.sh
```


Now we are ready to compute energy. The following command generates a scatter plot of _consistency energy_ vs. prediction error:

```bash
python -m scripts.energy_calc energy_calc --batch_size 2 --subset_size=128 --save_dir=results
```


By default, it computes the energy and error of the `subset_size` number of points on the Taskonomy buildings `almena` and `albertville`. The error is computed for the `normal` target. The resulting plot is saved to `energy.pdf` in `RESULTS_DIR` and the corresponding data to `data.csv`. 

#### Compute energy on arbitrary images
_Consistency energy_ is an unsupervised quantity and as such, no ground-truth labels are necessary. To compute the energy for all query images in a directory, run:

```bash
python -m scripts.energy_calc energy_calc_nogt 
    --data-dir=PATH_TO_QUERY_IMAGE --batch_size 1 --save_dir=RESULTS_DIR \
    --subset_size=NUMBER_OF_IMAGES --cont=PATH_TO_TRAINED_MODEL
```

It will append a dashed horizontal line to the plot above where the energy of the query image(s) are. This plot is saved to `energy.pdf` in `RESULTS_DIR`.

## Pretrained Models

We are providing all of our pretrained models for download. These models are the same ones used in the [live demo](https://consistency.epfl.ch/demo/) and [video evaluations](https://consistency.epfl.ch/visuals/).


#### Network Architecture
All networks are based on the [UNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) architecture. They take in an input size of 256x256, upsampling is done via bilinear interpolations instead of deconvolutions. All models were trained with the L1 loss.


#### Download consistency-trained models
Instructions for downloading the trained consistency models can be found [here](#download-consistency-trained-networks)
```bash
sh ./tools/download_models.sh
```

This downloads the `baseline`, `consistency` trained models for `depth`, `normal` and `reshading` target (1.3GB) to a folder called `./models/`. See the table below for specifics:

|        Task Name        | Output Dimension | Downsample Blocks |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `RGB -> Depth-ZBuffer`  | 256x256x1        | 6                 |
| `RGB -> Reshading`      | 256x256x1        | 5                 |
| `RGB -> Surface-Normal` | 256x256x3        | 6                 |

Individual consistency models can be downloaded [here](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/QPvImzbbdjBKI5P).



#### Download perceptual networks
The pretrained perceptual models can be downloaded with the following command.

```bash
sh ./tools/download_percep_models.sh
```

This downloads the perceptual models for the `depth`, `normal` and `reshading` target (1.6GB). Each target has 7 pretrained models (from the other sources below).

```
Curvature         Edge-3D            Reshading
Depth-ZBuffer     Keypoint-2D        RGB       
Edge-2D           Keypoint-3D        Surface-Normal 
```

Perceptual model architectural hyperparameters are detailed in [transfers.py](./transfers.py), and some of the pretrained models were trained using L2 loss. For using these models with the provided training code, the pretrained models should be placed in the file path defined by `MODELS_DIR` in [utils.py](./utils.py#L25).

Individual perceptual models can be downloaded [here](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/aXu4EFaznqtNzsE).



#### Download baselines
We also provide the models for other baselines used in the paper. Many of these baselines appear in the [live demo](https://consistency.epfl.ch/demo/). The pretrained baselines can be downloaded [here](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/gdom4FpiiYo1Qay). Note that we will not be providing support for them.

## Training

We used the provided training code to train our consistency models on the Taskonomy dataset. We used 3 V100 (32GB) GPUs to train our models, running them for 500 epochs takes about a week. 

> **Runnable Example:** 
   You'll find that the code in the rest of this section expects about 12TB of data (9 single-image tasks from Taskonomy). For a quick runnable example that gives the gist, try the following:  
>     
>  First download the data and then start a visdom (logging) server:
>  ```bash
>  sh ./tools/download_data.sh # Starter data (388MB)
>  visdom &                    # To view the telemetry
>  ```
>  
>  Then, start the training using the following command, which cascades two models (trains a `normal` model using `curvature` consistenct on a training set of 512 images).  
>   ```bash
>   python -m train example_cascade_two_networks --k 1 --fast
>   ```
>   You can add more pereceptual losses by changing the config in `energy.py`. For example, train the above model using _both_ `curvature` and `2D edge` consistency:
>   ```bash
>   python -m train example_normal --k 2 --fast
>   ```

Assuming that you want to train on the full dataset or [on your own dataset], read on.
#### The code is structured as follows
```python
config/             # Configuration parameters: where to save results, etc.
    split.txt           # Train, val split
    jobinfo.txt         # Defines job name, base_dir
modules/            # Network definitions
train.py            # Training script
dataset.py          # Creates dataloader
energy.py           # Defines path config, computes total loss, logging
models.py           # Implements forward backward pass
graph.py            # Computes path defined in energy.py
task_configs.py     # Defines task specific preprocessing, masks, loss fn
transfers.py        # Loads models
utils.py            # Defines file paths (described below) 
demo.py             # Demo script
```

#### Expected folder structure
The code expects folders structured as follows. These can be modified by changing values in `utils.py`
```python
base_dir/                   # The following paths are defined in utils.py (BASE_DIR)
    shared/                 # with the corresponding variable names in brackets
        models/             # Pretrained models (MODELS_DIR)
        results_[jobname]/  # Checkpoint of model being trained (RESULTS_DIR)
        ood_standard_set/   # OOD data for visualization (OOD_DIR)
    data_dir/               # taskonomy data (DATA_DIRS)
```

#### Training with consistency

   
1) **Define locations for data, models, etc.:** Create a `jobinfo.txt` file and define the name of the job and the absolute path to `BASE_DIR` where data, models results would be stored, as shown in the folder structure above. An example config is provided in the starter code (`configs/jobinfo.txt`). To modify individual file paths eg. the models folder, change `MODELS_DIR` variable name in [utils.py](./utils.py#L25).  
  
   We won't cover downloading the Taskonomy dataset, which can be downloaded following the instructions [here](https://github.com/StanfordVL/taskonomy/tree/master/data)

2) **Download perceptual networks:** If you want to initialize from our pretrained models, then then [download them](#Download-perceptual-networks) with the following command (1.6GB): 
    ```bash
    sh ./tools/download_percep_models.sh
    ```
    More info about the networks is available [here](#Download-perceptual-networks).

3) **Train with consistency** using the command:

   ```bash
   python -m train multiperceptual_{depth,normal,reshading}
   ```

   For example, to run the training code for the `normal` target, run 

   ```bash
   python -m train multiperceptual_normal
   ```

   This trains the model for the `normal` target with 8 perceptual losses ie. `curvature`, `edge2d`, `edge3d`, `keypoint2d`, `keypoint3d`, `reshading`, `depth` and `imagenet`. We used 3 V100 (32GB) GPUs to train our models, running them for 500 epochs takes about a week.

   Additional arugments can be specified during training, the most commonly used ones are listed below. For the full list, refer to the [training script](./train.py).
   - The flag `--k` defines the number of perceptual losses used, thus reducing GPU memory requirements.
   - There are several options for choosing how this subset is chosen 1. randomly (`--random-select`) 2. winrate (`--winrate`)
   - Data augmentation is not done by default, it can be added to the training data with the flag `--dataaug`. The transformations applied are 1. random crop with probability 0.5 2. [color jitter](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html?highlight=color%20jitter#torchvision.transforms.ColorJitter) with probability 0.5.

   To train a `normal` target domain with 2 perceptual losses selected randomly each epoch, run the following command.

   ```bash
   python -m train multiperceptual_normal --k 2 --random-select
   ```

4) **Logging:** The losses and visualizations are logged in Visdom. This can be accessed via `[server name]/env/[job name]` eg. `localhost:8888/env/normaltarget_allperceps`. 

   An example visualization is shown below. We plot the the outputs from the paths defined in the energy configuration used. Two windows are shown, one shows the predictions before training starts, the other updates them after each epoch. The labels for each column can be found at the top of the window. The second column has the target's ground truth `y^`, the third its prediction `n(x)` from the RGB image `x`. Thereafter, the predictions of each pair of images with the same domain are given by the paths `f(y^),f(n(x))`, where `f` is from the target domain to another domain eg. `curvature`.

   ![](./assets/visdom_eg.png)

   **Logging conventions:** For uninteresting historical reasons, the columns in the logging during training might have strange names. You can define your own names instead of using these by changing the config file in `energy.py`.
   
   Here's a quick guide to the current convention. For example, when training with a `normal` model using consistency:
    - The RGB input is denoted as `x` and the `target` domain is denoted as `y`. The ground truth label for a domain is marked with a `^`(e.g. `y^` for the for `target` domain). 
    - The direct (`RGB -> Z`) and perceptual (`target [Y] -> Z`) transfer functions are named as follows:<br>(i.e. the function for `rgb` to `curvature` is `RC`; for `normal` to `curvature` it's `f`)

   |  Domain (Z) | `rgb -> Z`<br>(Direct) | `Y -> Z`<br>(Perceptual) ||    Domain (Z)   | `rgb -> Z`<br>(Direct) | `Y -> Z`<br>(Perceptual) |
   |-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
   | target      | n                      | -                        || keypoints2d     | k2                     | Nk2                       |
   | curvature   | RC                     | f                        || keypoints3d     | k3                     | Nk3                       |
   | sobel edges | a                      | s                        || edge occlusion  | E0                     | nE0                       |

#### To train on other target domains
1. A new configuration should be defined in the `energy_configs` dictionary in [energy.py](./energy.py#L39-L521).

   - `paths`: `X1->X2->X3`. The keys in this dictionary uses a function notation eg. `f(n(x))`, with its corresponding value being a list of task objects that defines the domains being transfered eg. `[rgb, normal, curvature]`. The `rgb` input is defined as `x`, `n(x)` returns `normal` predictions from `rgb`, and `f(n(x))` returns `curvature` from `normal`. These notations do not need to be same for all configurations. The [table](#function-definitions) below lists those that have been kept constant for all targets.
   - `freeze_list`: the models that will not be optimized,
   - `losses`: loss terms to be constructed from the paths defined above,
   - `plots`: the paths to plots in the visdom environment.

2. New models may need to be defined in the `pretrained_transfers` dictionary in [transfers.py](./transfers.py#L26-L97). For example, for a `curvature` target, and perceptual model `curvature` to `normal`, the code will look for the `principal_curvature2normal.pth` file in `MODELS_DIR` if it is not defined in [transfers.py](./transfers.py#L26-L97).



#### To train on other datasets
The expected folder structure for the data is,
```
DATA_DIRS/
  [building]_[domain]/
      [domain]/
          [view]_domain_[domain].png
          ...
```
Pytorch's dataloader _\_\_getitem\_\__ method has been overwritten to return a tuple of all tasks for a given building and view point. This is done in [datasets.py](./datasets.py#L181-L198). Thus, for other folder structures, a function to get the corresponding file paths for different domains should be defined. 

For task specific configs, like transformations and masks, are defined in [task_configs.py](./task_configs.py#L341-L373).
